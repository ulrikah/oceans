# oceans
Project repository for an installation for [NTNU Oceans](https://www.ntnu.edu/oceans).

The auditory elements in the installation are triggered through Ableton Live. The full project can be found in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qBCEw25O48Z_WGFSgdTI3EYv6E2A5TFZ). NB: requires Ableton Live 10.

The Max For Live device that is to be used together with the Ableton Live project is `OCEANS.amxd`. In order to use it, download this repository and drag it onto a MIDI track in the Live project.

The subfolders of this repository contains separate parts of the installation system. However, they are not needed to use the standalone Max For Live device. The documentation for the specific parts is found within the respective folders.
