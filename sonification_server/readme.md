# Sonification server

This part of the repository contains a prototype of a client-server architecture for sonifying data queried dynamically from either Max For Live or Pure Data (Pd) through an SQLite interface in Python.

## Setup

To set it up, you need to have [python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [Pd](https://puredata.info/) installed.

The versions that have been used are:

- `python 3.7.5`
- `pip 19.3.1`
- `Pd 0.50.0`
- `sqlite 3.24.0`

Clone the repository and navigate to the `oceans/sonification_server` folder in your terminal.

```bash
pip install python-osc
cat data/db.sql |Â sqlite3 chemicals.db # filling the database
python osc_server.py # starts the server
```

Open a new tab/window in your shell, and then type the following to imitate client interaction:

```bash
python debug.py # starts a debug script that mocks user interaction
```

## Using the M4L device

Drag `OceansSonification.amxd` onto a MIDI track in Ableton Live and update the parameters as shown in this video.

If the Python scripts are running and it is connected at UDP port 8000, you should see the visual indicator in the M4L device.

## Using the Pd client

To open the Pd client, simply open `bridge.pd`. Try stopping the `debug.py` script to interact with the year slider.
